# ⏱️ Chess Clock – Journal

**Total Time Spent So Far:** ~17 hours

---

## 🧠 Idea & Planning – 1.5 hours  
- Brainstormed the concept of a compact, custom chess clock  
- Defined key features: two-player timer, buzzer alert, LED indicators, and a custom enclosure  
- Sketched initial design ideas on paper

---

## 📦 Cardboard Prototyping – 1 hour  
- Made a basic cardboard prototype to get a feel for the clock’s size and layout  
- Used it to test rough positioning of buttons and screen  
- Helped decide final dimensions before moving to CAD

---

## 🔌 Component Research & Sourcing – 2 hours  
- Listed all electronic and mechanical components  
- Checked which parts I already had (school or home)  
- Found remaining parts (e.g. LCD, USB cable) on Lazada

---

## 🖥️ Enclosure Design with Onshape – 2 hours  
- Designed a 3D enclosure using **Onshape**  
- Adjusted dimensions for proper fit of Arduino, screen, buttons, etc.  
- Created multiple cutouts for ports and components

---

## 🧪 Circuit Simulation with TinkerCAD – 1.5 hours  
- Built a virtual prototype of the full circuit using **TinkerCAD**  
- Connected LCD, pushbuttons, LEDs, and buzzer to Arduino  
- Simulated timer logic and tested button interactions virtually

---

## 🪚 Laser-Cut Acrylic Prototype – 1 hour  
- Used the Onshape design to create a **laser-cut acrylic prototype**  
- Only tested the **fit of the LCD and buttons** (not the full build)  
- Helped confirm cutout sizes before final assembly

---

## 🔧 Breadboard Circuit Testing – 3 hours  
- Assembled the full circuit on a breadboard  
- Connected Arduino Uno to LCD, buttons, LEDs, and buzzer  
- Confirmed everything worked correctly before moving forward

---

## ✍️ Drawing & Design Sketching – 2 hours 
- Spent time sketching 4 initial design concepts for the chess clock on paper
- Explored different layouts for button placement, screen position, and overall size
- Selected the most functional layout and created 1 final detailed drawing to guide CAD modeling

---

## 💻 Coding – 3 hours  
- Wrote Arduino code for countdown timer, player switching, and buzzer alert  
- Synced LED indicators with each player's turn  
- Got help from one of my teachers to understand timer logic and debounce button inputs  
- Debugged and refined logic for clean performance
