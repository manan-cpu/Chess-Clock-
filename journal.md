🧾 Chess Clock Project – Engineering Journal
Total Time Spent: ~17 hours
Duration: May 1st – May 10th, 2025
Project Goal: Build a compact, fully-functional chess clock with player indicators, buzzer alerts, and a custom enclosure.

📅 Day 1 – May 1 (Wednesday)
🧠 Idea & Planning (1.5 hrs)

Brainstormed key features: dual-timer, buzzer alert, LED indicators, ergonomic layout.

Sketched 3 rough ideas in a notebook.

Decided on general dimensions and components (e.g. Arduino Uno, LCD, pushbuttons).

📅 Day 2 – May 2 (Thursday)
📦 Cardboard Prototyping (1 hr)

Created a quick cardboard mock-up based on design sketch.

Tested hand placement, screen visibility, and button spacing.

Helped finalize approximate enclosure size and layout.

📅 Day 3 – May 3 (Friday)
🔌 Component Research & Sourcing (2 hrs)

Made a full component checklist.

Verified available parts from home/school (e.g. Arduino, jumper wires, resistors).

Ordered missing parts (LCD, USB cable, RGB LEDs) from Lazada.

📅 Day 4 – May 4 (Saturday)
🖥️ Enclosure Design – Onshape (2 hrs)

Modeled the enclosure in Onshape CAD.

Included cutouts for buttons, screen, ports, and ventilation.

Adjusted internal dimensions to snugly fit components.

📅 Day 5 – May 5 (Sunday)
🧪 Circuit Simulation – TinkerCAD (1.5 hrs)

Built the full circuit in TinkerCAD: LCD, buzzer, buttons, LEDs.

Simulated button interactions and timer countdown logic.

Identified logic bugs and refined wiring plan.

📅 Day 6 – May 6 (Monday)
🪚 Laser-Cut Acrylic Prototype (1 hr)

Used CAD model to laser-cut an acrylic prototype panel.

Tested alignment of LCD and button cutouts only (no full assembly).

Confirmed fit and spacing were accurate.

📅 Day 7 – May 7 (Tuesday)
🔧 Breadboard Circuit Testing (1.5 hrs)

Started assembling the actual circuit on a breadboard.

Connected: Arduino Uno + LCD + 2 pushbuttons + 2 LEDs + 1 buzzer.

Tested component behavior and interactions manually.

📅 Day 8 – May 8 (Wednesday)
🔧 Breadboard Circuit Testing (continued) (1.5 hrs)

Finalized breadboard wiring.

Verified debounce logic using simple serial prints.

Confirmed LEDs switch correctly between players.

📅 Day 9 – May 9 (Thursday)
✍️ Drawing & Design Sketching (2 hrs)

Sketched 4 potential layout designs for screen/button placement.

Evaluated comfort, symmetry, and aesthetics.

Chose final layout and drew a detailed top-down & side-view design.

📅 Day 10 – May 10 (Friday)
💻 Arduino Coding (3 hrs)

Programmed base timer countdown and player switch system.

Synced LED indicators and buzzer alerts with turn transitions.

Teacher helped refine button debouncing and logic smoothing.

Debugged edge cases (e.g. buzzer not firing when time = 0).
